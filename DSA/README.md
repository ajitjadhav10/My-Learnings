1. Linear Search(Sequential Search): We want to find the target number(in this case it is 10) from a list of 1 to 20 both inclusive.
  - Start at the begining
  - Compare it with the target(if it matches the target, its the end)
  - Move sequentially
  - Reach the end of the list

An algorithm should be finite(it should not run for infinite amount of time)


- Time complexity: Time taken to execute an algorithm
- Space complexity: It is the amount of space utilized by the algorithm while executing


Binary search:
