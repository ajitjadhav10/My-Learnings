What is GitHub- It is  a product that offers remote servers for us to host our Git projects

What is Git-  Git is a version control system that is downloaded on our computer that allows us to collaborate with others. 

Installing Git on Mac:
- For installing Git on Mac, we'll make use of [Hombrew](https://brew.sh/). Homebrew is an open-source software package that allows us to install software on macOS
  
- First, open your terminal and run the following command:

**/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"**

- It will ask for your password, enter it and go to the next step

- Now, you can install git using this command:

**brew install git**

- Once you've installed it, you can check the version of your Git, using this command:

**git --version**


Now that Git is installed, we have to set-up our git environment using the **git config** command:


**git config --global user.name "your_github_username"**

**git config --global user.email "your_email_id"**

Note: Enter your Github username and email id in the above command


You can use the following commands to setup your defaullt text editor and the colors of your git console.

**git config --global core.editor emacs**

**git config --global color.ui true**


Congratulations! Your git is now installed and set up!
