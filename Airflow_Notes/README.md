1. What is Airflow?
- It is a tool that allows you to run workflows. Workflows are in the form of directed acyclic graphs(DAGs). DAGs are made up of nodes and connections, a node represents the work to be done and the connection between the nodes represents the flow of data and the dependencies between the tasks.
