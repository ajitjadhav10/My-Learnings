SELECT Candidate.name as name, COUNT(Vote.id) FROM Candidate
INNER JOIN Vote
ON Candidate.id=Vote.candidateId
GROUP BY Candidate.name
ORDER BY COUNT(Vote.id) DESC
)
SELECT name FROM TEMPT
LIMIT 1;


#OR

SELECT Candidate.name as name FROM Candidate
INNER JOIN Vote

GROUP BY Candidate.name
ORDER BY COUNT(Vote.id) DESC
LIMIT 1;
