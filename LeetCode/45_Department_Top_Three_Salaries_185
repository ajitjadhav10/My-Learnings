Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/department-top-three-salaries/


Solution:

WITH TEMP_t AS
(
SELECT d.name as Department, e.name as name, e.salary as Salary,
DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY e.salary DESC) as rnk1
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Department d
ON e.departmentId=d.id
)
SELECT Department, name as Employee, Salary FROM TEMP_t
WHERE rnk1<=3

Note: When you are looking for top performers based on department or worst performers based on a category, think of using temporary table/dense rank/rank/row number
Note to self: You cannot use the alias of the rank column in the where clause in the same query
