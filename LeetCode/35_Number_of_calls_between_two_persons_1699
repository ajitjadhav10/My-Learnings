35_Number_of_calls_between_two_persons_1699

SELECT IF(from_id<to_id, from_id, to_id) as person1, IF(from_id<to_id, to_id, from_id) as person2,
COUNT(*) as call_count,
SUM(duration) as total_duration
FROM Calls
GROUP BY person1,person2


# select IF(from_id < to_id, from_id,to_id) as person1,IF(from_id < to_id, to_id,from_id) as person2, COUNT(*) as call_count,
#  SUM(duration) as total_duration
# FROM Calls
#  GROUP BY person1,person2;

# SELECT 
# LEAST(from_id,to_id) as person1, 
# GREATEST(to_id, from_id) as person2, 
# COUNT(duration) as call_count, 
# SUM(duration) as total_duration
# FROM Calls
# GROUP BY person1, person2


Note: All three solutions yield a result, the first one, offered me the fastest run time.
