1) HAVING VS WHERE
- HAVING clause was added to SQL because WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG())

2) EXISTS
- The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery. The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records
