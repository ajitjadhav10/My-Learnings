What is MMM?
- Media mix models (MMMs) are statistical models used by advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their advertising spend.
- Media Mix Models use historical time-series data to predict sales based on advertising variables and some control variables like weather, seasonality and market competition.

MMMs are machine learning models that are used to answer causal questions like What was the ROAS of Google Ads? where the cause is the amount spent on google ads and the ROAS is the effect.
