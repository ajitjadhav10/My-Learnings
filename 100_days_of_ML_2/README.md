**1. Supervised Learning**

1. One of the main parts of machine learning is Supervised Learning. In supervised learning, we give the system a set inputs(x) as well as the outputs(y), these are used to train the model, in this way the model learns, this trained model is then used for making a prediction.

- Regression

Example: Regression is a type of Supervised learning method, in this we try to predict a number from infinitely many poss ible outputs. The below image is an example of Regression(Housing price prediction).

- Classification

Example: Breast cancer detection
